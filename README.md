### Supported platforms

 - **Android** version 2.2 (API level 8) or higher

## Getting Started

A typical lifecycle is as follows:
 - User installs your app for the first time
 - App starts, sees it has no existing data, makes a request to restore backup
 - No data is found, your app creates stub data
 - Users uses your app, generates data: Your app requests a backup
 - Further use, further backups...
 - User downloads your app onto a new device
 - App starts, sees it has no existing data, makes a request to restore backup
 - Data is found, restored and returned to your app
 - User continues where they left off

## API
